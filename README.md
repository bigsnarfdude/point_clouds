# Point Cloud Processing

This repository will contain convenience functions for processing point cloud
data.

# Cloned Repo is WIP


**NOTE: ** The function names, output, argument names, argument order, number of
arguments, etc may change at any moment based on my own whim and without notice.
As such, it is recommended that you copy and paste the sections you need into
your own code if you want to use any of it, instead of importing this repo as a
library (since it will likely break your own code everytime any of these changes
are made).
